<h3>Summary:</h3>
Hello, welcome to my portfolio. In this site I have compiled my experience, projects,  and education to give a summary of myself. I am planning to use this portfolio to market myself to prospective employers and to give out when connecting or networking with other people. 

<h3>🔎 About me :</h3>

I am a Georgia native that graduated from Tucker High School. I’ve spent my entire life living in Georgia. I have attended 3 major colleges within the metro Atlanta area and I am proud to represent them all. I am an aspiring machine learning engineer who chose my journey when I started college. I was initially intimidated by math courses but after being tasked with completing a math course to study business marketing (my original college major) I realized this was a task that would never go away. I worked as hard as I possibly could to study and cover the content for this math course(college algebra) and eventually I realized that math is not all that bad. After completing my first semester I asked my math professor to write a recommendation letter for me to receive a scholarship. He agreed but he wondered why I didn’t choose engineering as my major. I told him about how I felt about math and he revealed that I topped my class for overall grades and the final exam. I didn’t miss a single question. Before this, I always believed that I wasn’t capable of learning technical topics especially anything relevant to math. But after this meeting I was inspired to see myself for more than what I’d previously known. I decided to pursue engineering as my major. From there I graduated GSU-PC with an AS in Engineering and from Spelman College with a BS in Computer Science. I am now attending GA Tech to receive my BS in Computer Engineering.

<h3> My Career Goals :</h3>
In the next five years, my primary career goal is to establish myself as a proficient machine learning engineer or a data science specialist, ideally working remotely or based in Atlanta, though I am flexible about traveling for the right opportunities. Having pursued my education at Georgia Tech, I am on track to complete two degrees that are crucial stepping stones toward this goal. In terms of financial planning, I am mindful of the costs associated with my academic pursuits, which I project to be around $50,000, including tuition and necessary resources.

To enhance my candidacy and expertise further, I plan to achieve at least two additional certifications in areas like AI and big data analytics, which I estimate will cost an additional $5,000. My strategic actions to transition effectively into my desired career include: 1) securing internships with leading tech firms to gain practical, hands-on experience; 2) attending industry conferences and networking events to connect with professionals and thought leaders in the field; and 3) consistently contributing to open-source projects to build a robust portfolio that demonstrates my skills and commitment to continuous learning. These steps will ensure that I not only meet but exceed the expectations of potential employers in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
